This is a simple image manipulation project built on top of ImageMagick API.
The project specifically uses MagickWand api. The MagickWand api is provided by ImageMagick 
as it's C language binding. The project can be compiled locally on the user's machine
by first compiling ImageMagick from source and then compiling the header files.

This is the first version(1.0.0) of the project and demostrates simple features like converting the
image from one extension to other, cropping it and rotating the image to multiples of 90 degree.
The future version of this project will feature a gui to let the user interact more easily.
